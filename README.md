# {{ Ida Eriksson }} - Portfolio Task

[My portfolio site]( {{ https://idaanna.github.io/ }} )

## Project Requirements

### Content
{{ I have decided to do the layout of my portfolio so I can easily adjust it in the future. There are links to my LinkedIn and Github in the footer menu through the logo images and a direct link to LinkedIn in my header as LinkedIn is at the moment my most important medium. The porfile picture and biography is in my main section and the contact form can be found under the 'contact me' site }}
- [ ] At least one profile picture
- [ ] Biography (at least 100 words)
- [ ] Functional Contact Form
- [ ] "Projects" section
- [ ] Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.

### Technical
{{ I have deployed three webpages, the portfolio one, a contact me and a projects one. I have designed according to 'mobile first' design and then added media queries in my CSS. The project site has nothing of value atm so I won't include this in the screenshots }}
- [ ] At least 2 web pages.
- [ ] Version controlled with Git
- [ ] Deployed on GitHub pages.
- [ ] Implements responsive design principles.
- [ ] Uses semantic HTML.

### Bonus (optional)
{{ I have included that the links in my header change colours if you hover over them and then change colour again once you have clicked them. }}
- [ ] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [ ] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extra
tricky!)
### Screenshots

> - The different pages and features of your website on mobile, tablet and
desktop screen sizes (multiple screenshots per page and screen size).
> - The different features of your site, e.g. if you have hover states, take a
screenshot that shows that.
>

them in your readme document with the following Markdown code:
